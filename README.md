The subreddit AITA is a place where users can submit their personal stories to be judged by other reddit users for fault
The original poster, or OP, of each story should be posting something controversial with approximately a 50/50 split on who is the asshole of the story
After looking at the skew of verdicts in our dataset, we can quickly see the abundance of "Not the asshole" verdicts
meaning that OP is not at fault. So, why is the dataset heavily skewed in that direction? This is what we explore in our project
